nfc-emulate-forum-tag2 \- NFC Forum tag type 2 emulation command line demonstration tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfc-emulate-forum-tag2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfc-emulate-forum-tag2
is a demonstration tool that emulates a NFC Forum tag type 2 that contains a read-only NDEF message.
.SH NOTES
It have been developed using PN533 USB hardware as target and Google Nexus S phone as initiator.

This is know to NOT work with Nokia 6212 Classic and could not work with several NFC Forum compiliant devices due to these reasons:
   - The emulated target only have a 4 bytes UID where 7 bytes UID (as a real Mifare Ultralight tag) are usually attempted;
   - The chip is emulating a ISO/IEC 14443-3 tag, without any hardware helper.
   
If the initiator have too short timeouts for software-based emulation (which is usually the case), this example will failed, this is not a bug and we can't do anything using this kind of hardware (PN531/PN533).
