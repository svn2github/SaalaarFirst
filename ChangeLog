Improvments:
 - build: Build on FreeBSD;
 - build: Add alternative build system (CMake);

 - libnfc: Add driver agnostic nfc_pick_device(), nfc_list_devices();
 - libnfc: It is now possible to specify a wanted device using new struct "nfc_device_desc_t";
 - libnfc: Add device name to device descriptions (nfc_device_desc_t) to select a given PCSC device;
 - libnfc: Finally removed all dirty globals, it 'should' be thread-safe now;
 - libnfc: Less confusing message for bitstreams display;
 - libnfc: chips level introduction with pn53x.h/c;
 - drivers: Add PN532 UART driver;
 - drivers pn533_usb and pn531_usb: Lets search continuing to find other USB readers if any in PN531 and PN533 USB drivers;
 - drivers pn533_usb and pn531_usb: Support for the generic vendorid/productid of the NXP chip;
 - drivers pn533_usb and pn531_usb: Consolidate duplicated code;
 - examples: Add MIFARE Ultratag tool;
 - examples: Add man page for nfc-mfultool;
 - examples: MIFARE examples (mftool and mfultool) have now a better help message;
 - examples: Add NFCIP (NDEP) as experimental feature;
 - examples: add quiet mode to improve timing of emulate, relay and anticol commands;
 - nfc-list: List all devices in nfc-list(1);
 - nfc-list: Simply turns off the RF field upon exit;
 - nfc-emulate: allow UID to be specified;
 - nfc-relay: Initialize initiator device explicitly;
 - nfc-relay: Capture ctrl-c for quitting cleanly the relay attack application;
 - nfc-relay: exit properly if emulator initialization failed;
 - nfc-mfclassic: Add default keys tries;

Changes:
 - API: Rename tag_info to nfc_target_info_t;
 - API: Rename init_modulation to nfc_modulation_t;
 - API: Rename dev_config_option to nfc_device_option_t;
 - API: Use NULL instead of INVALID_DEVICE_INFO to know if device is valid;
 - API: Rename chip_type to nfc_chip_t;
 - API: Rename dev_spec to nfc_device_spec_t;
 - API: Rename dev_info struct to nfc_device_t;
 - API: Variables have been renamed to match coding conventions;
 - API: Changed length parmeters from uint32_t to size_t;
 - Files: Remove defines.h public header;
 - Files: Prefix messages.h and types.h headers by "nfc-";
 - Files: Revamp libnfc source tree;
 - Files: Move examples into src/examples subdirectory;
 - Examples: Rename nfc-mftool to nfc-mfclassic;
 - Examples: Rename nfc-mfultool to nfc-mfultralight;
