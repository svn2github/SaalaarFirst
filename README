can be sent directly to libnfc's developers: http://www.libnfc.org/contact

Building
========

It should be as simple as running these two commands:

./configure
make

Troubleshooting
===============

Using a ACR122 device (and ACR122 only, not touchatag) with libnfc needs some
PCSC-lite configuration:
* Allow CCID Exchange command;
* And if your device have a bogus firmware you could allow PCSC to use bogus devices.

To do this, /etc/libccid_Info.plist and locate "<key>ifdDriverOptions</key>",
turn "<string>0x0000</string>" value into 0x0001 to allow CCID exchange or
0x0005 to allow CCID exchange and bogus devices.
