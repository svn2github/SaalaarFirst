 * @brief Transceive raw bit-frames
 * @return Returns true if action was successfully performed; otherwise returns false.
 * @param pbtTx contains a byte array of the frame that needs to be transmitted.
 * @param uiTxBits contains the length in bits.
 * @note For example the REQA (0×26) command (first anti-collision command of ISO14443-A) must be precise 7 bits long. This is not possible by using nfc_initiator_transceive_bytes(). With that function you can only communicate frames that consist of full bytes. When you send a full byte (8 bits + 1 parity) with the value of REQA (0×26), a tag will simply not respond. More information about this can be found in the anti-colision example. 
 * @param pbtTxPar parameter contains a byte array of the corresponding parity bits needed to send per byte.
 * @note For example if you send the SELECT_ALL (0×93, 0×20) = [ 10010011, 00100000 ] command, you have to supply the following parity bytes (0×01, 0×00) to define the correct odd parity bits. This is only an example to explain how it works, if you just are sending two bytes with ISO14443-A compliant parity bits you better can use the nfc_initiator_transceive_bytes() function.
 * @returns The received response from the tag will be stored in the parameters (pbtRx, puiRxBits and pbtRxPar). They work the same way as the corresponding parameters for transmission.
 *
 * The NFC reader will transmit low-level messages where only the modulation is handled by the PN53X chip. Construction of the frame (data, CRC and parity) is completely done by libnfc. This can be very useful for testing purposes. Some protocols (e.g. MIFARE Classic) require to violate the ISO14443-A standard by sending incorrect parity and CRC bytes. Using this feature you are able to simulate these frames.

 * @return Returns true if action was successfully performed; otherwise returns false.
 *
 * The reader will transmit the supplied bytes in pbtTx to the target (tag). It waits for the response and stores the received bytes in the pbtRx byte array. The parity bits are handled by the PN53X chip. The CRC can be generated automatically or handled manually. Using this function, frames can be communicated very fast via the NFC reader to the tag. Tests show that on average this way of communicating is much faster than using the regular driver/middle-ware (often supplied by manufacturers).
