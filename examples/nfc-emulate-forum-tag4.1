nfc-emulate-forum-tag4 \- NFC Forum tag type 4 emulation command line demonstration tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfc-emulate-forum-tag4
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfc-emulate-forum-tag4
is a demonstration tool that emulates a NFC Forum tag type 4 with NDEF content.

Currently, this tool only works with a Nokia 6212 Classic phone as initiator
and a PN532-equipped NFC device as target.

This example uses the hardware capability of PN532 to handle ISO/IEC 14443-4
low-level frames like RATS/ATS, WTX, etc.

At the moment, only the Nokia 6212 Classic can be used with this example
because it's based on a pre-established communication plan and the tool sends
blindly the expected replies to the initiator without having interpreted the queries.
